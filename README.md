# batchsystem
This project was completed by myself and my partner which was a requirement for the project. This program is an inventory system, capable of recording and tracking specific batches, components, and their specific details to JSON and pickle files. For example, this includes details such as batch numbers, number of components in a specific batch as well as the type and size of a component. The end user is able to create and search for specific batches and components recorded by the batch system. The project is split into two different steps as this is how the project was assessed at the end of the year.
